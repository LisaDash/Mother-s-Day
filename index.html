        <h1>Happy Mother's Day !!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>No other being on Earth can love us as unconditionally as our mothers do. 
            
            Our mothers try to shield us from all harm and help us in however way they can.
            
            Mothers are thought to be one of the most powerful creatures on Earth.
            
            The greatest kind of love is a motherâ€™s love in any animal species.
            
            Many others can hardly imagine the sacrifices a mother is possible of making.</p>

        <p>Mother is a real blessing of God upon this world.There is no match for the love of mother. We can not find the examples of her love in this world. It is the mother who is always concerned about everything for us. My mother is my best friend. She can understand me and help me to solve my problems. She is always ready to give any sacrifice for my wishes and my needs.
            It is with the prayers and blessing of our mothers that we always become successful in every walk of life. She works very hard to take care of the needs of all family members of house. I love my mother because she always help my father and every family member in all decisions of life. My mother is very much concerned about my health. She is very upset when I am not fine.       <br>
            You are the best mom in the world. Happy Mother's Day!
